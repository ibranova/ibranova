I’m a Data Analyst driven by curiosity, resilience, and a strong commitment to continuous learning. I grew up in Guinea, West Africa, where access to technology was very limited for me growing up, but I was so facined about Inovations. After moving to the U.S., I taught myself English, adapted to a new culture quickly, and intentionally built the skills and mindset needed to work in tech.

I am currently completing an intensive Data Analytics training program at [The Marcy Lab School](https://www.marcylabschool.org/), where I developed hands-on experience with data analysis, problem-solving, and critical thinking using tools like Python and SQL. What defines me most is my discipline, growth mindset, curiosity, and desire to use data to find solutions that have real-world impact.

This GitHub is where I document my learning journey, share projects, and continue growing one step at a time.
## About Me
I'm a **Data Analyst** based in **New York City** with a passion for transforming complex datasets into actionable business insights. Currently completing **1,800+ hours** of immersive training in data analysis, statistics, machine learning, and visualization at The Marcy Lab School.

🏆 **2nd Place Winner** — MTA Datathon 2025 (out of 180+ teams)
